# levelup-lwc

## Prerequisites

$ volta install yarn@1.22.10

## Sessions

The most common way to start a LWC OSS projects is using create-lwc-app. But the idea here is to go step by step, installing, configuring, coding and testing so we can deeply understand what internally is going on.

We will go session by session. There is a branch per session so in case we want to see that running just clone it, and in case you want to skip to a session you can checkout the previous one.

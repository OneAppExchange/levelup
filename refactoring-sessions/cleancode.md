## Naminng
- Choose names thoughfully
- Choosing name to communicate your intent
- If you need to put a comment, then is a bad name
- Avoid disinformation. Make sure tha says what it means, and means what it says
- If you need to read the code, the is a bad name too
- Pronounceable names
- Avoid encodings (like Hungarian notation, dont need track types with new IDE)
- Choose parse of Speech well
  - Variable nouns
  - Methods verb names
  - If booleans make predicables, so if can read as a sentence
  - Variable names should be short is scope is small like one letter, but for variables with long scope should be lond
  - Function follows the opposite rule, should be short is have long scope (public api will be better like invoke), and should be long for small scope, so can be more descriptive
- Classes also, nice short names for public classes, and long names for private classes

## Functions 
- Need to be small
- Classes are hide in long functions
- Ccall function is no longer an overhead. In worst case look to inline functions in the lowest nesting loops
- Need to do one thing, but mean one thing may be complicated. Extract till drop is the mechanism
- Need to be only level of abstraction. This can also be complicated.

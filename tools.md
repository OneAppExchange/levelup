Let's start looking for some usefull 


## Husky


## Jest 


## Sa11y


## Webpack Bundle Analyzer

This visual tool is interesting to understand what we are deploying and the size of each library we are using. 

```bash
# NPM
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
# Yarn
yarn add -D webpack-bundle-analyzer
```
